## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

  - Functions allow you to package up code for later use in your program

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

  - a `function` keyword, followed by an optional name, followed by one or more `parameters` surrounded by parenthesis `()`, followed by a `code block` surrounded by curly brackets `{}`
  - `function myFun(parameters) { code block }`

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

  - `functionName` followed by one or more `arguments` surrounded by parenthesis `()`
  - `myFun('argument1', 'argument2', true)`

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

  - A `code block` and a `function` keyword

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

  - `parameter`'s are used to pass data when defining the function
  - `argument`'s are used to pass data into a function when it is called

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

  - `parameters` are used in a function definition to execute code based on the data that is passed with parameters

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

  - a `return` statement will produce data from the function as well as exit the function, no code executes after the return keyword is invoked

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?

  - (a, b) => { return a + b }

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  - a return statement is not expected
  - (a, b) => a + b
